## Known Carry-Forwards

- **Sidecar proof**: Rust sidecar last proved at hysight-42. Subtree hash above provides verifiable evidence of no source change.
- **Python contract / Rust sidecar feature parity**: `user_id`, `embedding`, `mode` fields supported by Rust sidecar are not yet in the Python `ContractModel`. Documented and tracked; not a runtime regression.
