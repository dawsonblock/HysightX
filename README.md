Hysight is a bounded operator runtime for Hybrid Cognitive Agent workflows. The runtime keeps execution inside one authority path: proposals enter a capacity-limited workspace, approved actions flow through the executor, every transition is written to storage, and the backend plus frontend read that replay-backed state back out. The supported local workflow starts with proof, not with ad hoc service startup.

## What Hysight Is

Hysight implements a Hybrid Cognitive Agent as a bounded runtime rather than an open-ended autonomy loop.

Core properties:

- Bounded authority: modules can propose, but only the executor and registry can actually perform work.
- Replay-backed operations: the operator UI, API summaries, receipts, approvals, and artifacts all read from stored run state.
- Proof-first development: the shortest supported path is `python scripts/run_tests.py`.
- Explicit approvals: mutation and other configured side effects fail closed without approval.
- Graceful degradation: optional LLM-assisted modules fall back to deterministic behavior when external model dependencies are unavailable.

Inside the current proof surface:

- The runtime authority path under `hca/src/hca/runtime/`
- The deployed FastAPI surface at `backend.server:app`
- The replay-backed operator console in `frontend/`
- The optional memvid sidecar contract behind the backend memory boundary

Outside the current proof surface unless explicitly wired into the authority path:

- Experimental cognition stubs under `hca/src/hca/modules/`
- Experimental meta and prediction helpers not named by the runtime authority path

## System Overview

The canonical deployed HTTP surface is `backend.server:app`. The FastAPI app in `hca/src/hca/api/app.py` is a compatibility surface for repo-local tests and inspection, not the normal deployment target.

At a glance:

| Layer | Responsibility | Primary path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | State machine, workflow orchestration, replay | `hca/src/hca/runtime/` |
| Executor | Approval enforcement and bounded tool dispatch | `hca/src/hca/executor/` |
| Workspace | Capacity-limited proposal competition and ranking | `hca/src/hca/workspace/` |
| Backend | Public HTTP API, memory routes, subsystem status | `backend/` |
| Frontend | Live chat plus replay-backed operator console | `frontend/` |
| Sidecar | Optional Rust-backed memory service | `memvid_service/` |
| Contracts | API schema and runtime/operator docs | `contract/`, `hca/docs/` |

## Quick Start

If you only do one thing, run the proof surface first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dawsonblock/Hysight.git
cd Hysight

make venv
source .venv/bin/activate

cp .env.example .env

make test-bootstrap
make test
```

That path creates the repo-local virtual environment, installs the default backend proof surface, and runs the service-free baseline proof contract.

Then start the app stack you actually want:

```bash
# backend API
./scripts/run_backend.sh

# optional frontend
make test-bootstrap-frontend
cd frontend && yarn start
```

Important bootstrap facts:

- The Python runtime package lives under `./hca`.
- `make venv` installs `backend/requirements-test.txt`, which installs editable `./hca`.
- The repo root is a workspace/meta-project; `python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'` at the root installs tooling only and does not install the runtime package surface.
- The default proof surface does not require MongoDB or a running sidecar.
- The frontend is pinned to Node 24 and Yarn 1.22.22 and validates its runtime on install.

## Proof Surfaces

`python scripts/run_tests.py` is the single proof authority for the default local backend surface. `./scripts/proof_local.sh` is intentionally a thin wrapper over that command.

Current baseline expectations:

| Step | Expected passing tests |
| --- | --- |
| HCA pipeline | 7 |
| Backend baseline | 98 |
| Contract conformance | 18 |
| Overall baseline | 123 |
| Autonomy optional | 66 |

Supported proof tiers:

| Tier | Command | Requires live services | Main receipt |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default local proof | `python scripts/run_tests.py` | No | `artifacts/proof/baseline.json` |
| Pipeline only | `python scripts/run_tests.py --baseline-step pipeline` | No | `artifacts/proof/pipeline.json` |
| Backend baseline only | `python scripts/run_tests.py --baseline-step backend-baseline` | No | `artifacts/proof/backend-baseline.json` |
| Contract only | `python scripts/run_tests.py --baseline-step contract` | No | `artifacts/proof/contract.json` |
| Frontend proof | `python scripts/run_tests.py --frontend` or `make proof-frontend` | No | `artifacts/proof/frontend.json` |
| Backend integration proof | `python scripts/run_tests.py --integration` or `make test-backend-integration` | No | `artifacts/proof/integration.json` |
| Live Mongo proof | `make proof-mongo-live` | Docker Mongo harness | `artifacts/proof/live-mongo.json` |
| Live sidecar proof | `make proof-sidecar` | Rust sidecar harness | `artifacts/proof/live-sidecar.json` |

Proof artifacts and generated evidence:

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `artifacts/proof/` | Latest proof receipts |
| `artifacts/proof/history/` | Timestamped history receipts for live Mongo and live sidecar proofs |
| `test_reports/pytest/` | JUnit XML output for proof steps |
| `storage/` | Replay-backed runtime state, snapshots, approvals, artifacts, and event logs |

Receipt honesty notes:

- Aggregate receipts now declare `covered_proof_steps`, `omitted_proof_steps`, `passed_proof_steps`, and `failed_proof_steps` so a baseline receipt does not imply that frontend, integration, or live proofs ran.
- Frontend receipts also declare `covered_stage_names`, `passed_stage_names`, and `failed_stage_names` so fixture drift, lint, Jest, and build coverage stay explicit.

Frontend proof details:

- Node runtime verification
- API fixture drift verification
- ESLint
- Jest
- Production build

## Release Seal Status

The current release is **Hysight-47**.
Proved at commit `ea65d66580f885114b61e51cdea59db6f5249447` (all 6 proof receipts).
Packaged at commit `ce9de158c1154a6354d9bed0eb92d886bc0980e2` (tree receipt, seal docs).

**Classification: sealed local-core release**

- Baseline proof: 123 passed, 0 failed (7 pipeline + 98 backend-baseline + 18 contract)
- Autonomy optional proof: 66 passed, 0 failed
- Frontend proof: 71 passed, 0 failed (all 5 stages: runtime-verification, fixture-drift, lint, vitest, build)
- Live Rust sidecar: CARRY-FORWARD from hysight-42 (13/0, no sidecar source changed)
- Live Mongo proof was not rerun in this release and is not counted as fresh evidence

Authoritative release-truth document: `RELEASE_SEAL_HYSIGHT47.md`.

Older Hysight 27–46 summary files remain in the repository as audit history only and are not
proof for the current release.

## Run Modes

### 1. Default backend-only mode

This is the standard local runtime path.

```bash
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate
cp .env.example .env
./scripts/run_backend.sh
```

Public API:

- Root: `http://localhost:8000/api/`
- OpenAPI docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Subsystem status: `http://localhost:8000/api/subsystems`

Notes:

- `MEMORY_BACKEND=python` is the default.
- `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL` must be unset in python mode.
- If `MONGO_URL` and `DB_NAME` are both unset, the backend still serves the HCA and memory routes; Mongo-backed `/api/status` persistence remains disabled.
- `GET /api/subsystems` now also surfaces the bounded autonomy control plane: kill switch state, pending escalations, recent active runs, per-agent budget ledgers, last evaluator decision, and the latest checkpoint summary.

### 2. Frontend plus backend

```bash
make test-bootstrap-frontend
cd frontend
yarn start
```

Frontend details:

- React 19 single-page app
- Default local URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Requests proxy to `http://localhost:8000` by default
- Operator layout combines live chat with a replay-backed console for recent runs, event history, approvals, and stored artifacts

If you need a non-default backend origin, copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and set `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`.

### 3. Optional local sidecar mode

Use this when you intentionally want the Rust-backed memory implementation.

```bash
MEMORY_SERVICE_PORT=3031 make run-memvid-sidecar
MEMORY_BACKEND=rust MEMORY_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3031 ./scripts/run_backend.sh
```

If port `3031` is already occupied:

```bash
MEMORY_SERVICE_PORT=3032 make run-memvid-sidecar
MEMORY_SERVICE_PORT=3032 make proof-sidecar
```

### 4. Container deployment

Default local deployment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Optional sidecar overlay:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.sidecar.yml up --build
```

What the sidecar overlay adds:

- `MEMORY_BACKEND=rust`
- `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL=http://memvid-sidecar:3031`
- `MEMORY_DATA_DIR=/app/data`
- A health-checked backend dependency on the sidecar

## Configuration

Copy the shared environment template before local runs or container runs:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key variables:

| Variable | Default | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMORY_BACKEND` | `python` | No | Set to `rust` only when using the sidecar |
| `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL` | unset | Only in `rust` mode | Must stay unset in `python` mode |
| `HCA_STORAGE_ROOT` | `<repo>/storage` | No | Absolute run storage root |
| `MEMORY_STORAGE_DIR` | `<HCA_STORAGE_ROOT>/memory` | No | Must be an absolute child path under `HCA_STORAGE_ROOT` |
| `MONGO_URL` | unset | Paired with `DB_NAME` | Set both or neither |
| `DB_NAME` | unset | Paired with `MONGO_URL` | Set both or neither |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | unset | No | Comma-separated absolute origins only |
| `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` | unset | For real agent runs | Optional for some proof-only paths |

Fail-closed configuration rules:

- `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL` is rejected unless `MEMORY_BACKEND=rust`.
- `MEMORY_STORAGE_DIR` must stay inside `HCA_STORAGE_ROOT`.
- `MONGO_URL` and `DB_NAME` must be set together or omitted together.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` cannot contain `*`.

## API Surface

The frontend and the operator workflows use the same replay-backed backend surface. There is no second UI-only state model.

Example calls:

```bash
# root
curl http://localhost:8000/api/

# subsystem readiness
curl http://localhost:8000/api/subsystems

# recent runs
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/hca/runs?limit=5"

# newest events for one run

# replay-backed artifact list
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/hca/run/<run-id>/artifacts?limit=20"
```

## CLI Commands

The installed `./hca` package also exposes repo-local CLI entry points:

```bash
# single goal smoke test
hca-smoke "summarize the latest quarterly report"

# evaluation harnesses
hca-eval all --json

# replay a prior run
hca-replay --run-id <run-id>
```

## Developer Workflow

Common commands:

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Create repo-local venv | `make venv` |
| Install default test surface | `make test-bootstrap` |
| Install frontend deps | `make test-bootstrap-frontend` |
| Install integration extras | `make test-bootstrap-integration` |
| Install dev tooling | `make dev-bootstrap` |
| Run full local proof surface | `make test` |
| Run fixture drift guard | `make test-fixture-drift` |
| Run backend baseline only | `make test-backend-baseline` |
| Run contract proof only | `make test-contract` |
| Run pipeline proof only | `make test-pipeline` |
| Run frontend proof wrapper | `make proof-frontend` |
| Run integration proof | `make test-backend-integration` |
| Run live Mongo proof harness | `make proof-mongo-live` |
| Run live sidecar proof harness | `make proof-sidecar` |

Notes for local development:

- The proof runner isolates `HCA_STORAGE_ROOT` and `MEMORY_STORAGE_DIR` per proof step so verification does not depend on leftover repo state.
- The frontend is pinned to Node 24 and Yarn 1.22.22 and validates its runtime on install.
- `backend/tests/test_server_bootstrap.py` acts as a repo-level contract sentinel for launch surfaces, proof workflows, and helper script behavior.

## Tech Stack

| Area | Primary tech |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | Python, FastAPI, Pydantic |
| Frontend | React 19, Vite, Vitest, Tailwind, Radix primitives |
| Proof | pytest, JUnit XML, proof receipts under `artifacts/proof/` |
| Data | Optional MongoDB for `/api/status` persistence |
| Sidecar | Rust, Axum, Tokio |

## Troubleshooting

### Proof runner says the runtime package is not resolving from `./hca`

Use the supported bootstrap path:

```bash
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make test-bootstrap
```

### `MemoryConfigurationError: MEMORY_SERVICE_URL is required`

You enabled `MEMORY_BACKEND=rust` without a healthy sidecar. Either:

- switch back to `MEMORY_BACKEND=python`, or
- start the sidecar and set `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3031`

### `MemoryConfigurationError: MEMORY_SERVICE_URL must be unset unless MEMORY_BACKEND=rust`

Remove `MEMORY_SERVICE_URL` while running in python mode.

### `BackendConfigurationError: Mongo configuration is partial`

Set both `MONGO_URL` and `DB_NAME`, or set neither.

### Frontend install fails runtime verification

The frontend expects Node 24 and Yarn 1.22.22. Align your local Node toolchain before running:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

### `CORS_ORIGINS` rejects `*`

Hysight does not allow wildcard CORS. Use explicit absolute origins such as:

```dotenv
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://app.example.com
```
